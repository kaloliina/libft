# libft

## Project Overview

Libft is a library of C functions that replicate many of the standard library functions. The goal of this project was to understand and implement these functions from scratch, gaining a deeper understanding of how they actually work.

## My Approach

I began by reviewing the project requirements and understanding what needed to be accomplished. This involved familiarizing myself with the specifications of each function. I aimed to implement each function step by step and test them thoroughly. Some functions were less familiar, so I decided to tackle them later, dedicating more time to understanding and implementing them. After I felt like I was finished with the project, I once again reviewed my code for each function to ensure that it worked as expected.

## Learnings

- Foundational Refresh: Libft was a great refresher for my C skills, covering all the basics from Piscine while also introducing more complex challenges along the way.

- Makefile Skills: I learned how to create Makefiles, which was completely unknown territory for me, and discovered how it simplifies the build process.

- Modularity: This might seem funny, but previously I had always written the code from scratch, and this project made me understand that I can easily utilize my existing functions in more complex ones.

- Attention to Detail: One of the biggest takeaways from Libft was the importance of being meticulous. Since I was working with so many standalone functions, I had to ensure each one worked perfectly. If I missed something, it could affect other functions and also be frustrating for future projects.

## Future Directions

I plan to add more functions to the library to make it more comprehensive. I would also love to review the functions once again, to make sure that I utilize my other existing functions in a robust way.

## How to Run the Project

- Setup Instructions: To use Libft, clone the repository and compile the source files using the provided Makefile.

- Usage Examples: Include Libft in your projects by linking against the compiled library and using its functions in your code.
